===================================

.. _script:


There is a Python script *compute_two_photon_matrix_element.py* containing examples for one-photon and two-photon matrix elements and the calculation of the light-shift and ionization probability, which can be found `here <https://github.com/delande/hame/blob/main/compute_two_photon_matrix_element.py>`_.
